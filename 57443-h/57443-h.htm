<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> is a brief but general account of the history
of aviation as it is associated with southern
California, a description of the War Department
school of aviation at San Diego, a syllabus of
the course of lectures delivered there on the subject
of practical meteorology as applied to aviation, a
narrative of weather-study from an airplane, and a
recital of subsequent active coöperation between the
aviators and the U. S. Weather Bureau.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> It may be remembered that the weather service of the United States
originated with the Signal Corps of the Army and that the Weather
Bureau was created from it by Act of Congress, June, 1891, and made a
bureau of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. As a former member of
the Signal Corps the writer enjoyed the renewal of old friendships among
the officers at the Aviation School. Col. W. A. Glassford, Signal Corps,
U. S. Army, Commandant of the War Department Aviation School at
San Diego, kindly read the manuscript of the following pages and the
writer gratefully acknowledges his valuable suggestions.</p></div>

<p>Much of the material in the following pages was
obtained by the writer while detailed as Lecturer in
Meteorology to the Signal Corps, War Department
Aviation School at San Diego, in 1915–1916, also
when detailed in the same official capacity to
the U. S. Army Military Training Encampment,
Monterey, 1916; and at the summer sessions of the
University of California during 1914–1916.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SIGNAL CORPS AVIATION SCHOOL AT
SAN DIEGO</span></h2>

<p><i>History.</i>—The year 1911 marked the beginning
of the United States aviation school at San Diego.
There is no finer tribute to the equability and general
excellence of the climate of southern California than
that given in the history of aëronautics. It was here,
in 1900, that Chanute completed his early and epoch-making
observations of the flight of gulls and pelicans.
These contributed largely to the success of
the Wright brothers a few years afterward. It was
in southern California, six years ago, that Harkness,
in an Antoinette, made his record monoplane flight
to Tia Juana. San Diego witnessed the flying of the
first seaplane, by Curtiss, five years ago. It is in
this district that not only the War Department
aviation school and a number of commercial flying
schools are located, but also one of the large airplane<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a>
factories in this country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The National Advisory Committee for Aëronautics in its report of
October 17, 1916, on Nomenclature for Aëronautics, the name <em>airplane</em> is
substituted for “Any form of aircraft heavier than air which has wing
surfaces for sustention, with stabilizing surfaces, rudders for steering, and
power-plant for propulsion through the air.”</p></div>

<p><i>Location of the School.</i>—Whatever the final action
may be as to permanent location, it has been conceded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
by all authorities that the situation of the
aviation school on North Island, San Diego Bay, is
ideal. (See <a href="#ip_53">Fig. 21</a>.) The so-called island is connected
with the peninsula of Coronado by a narrow sand-spit,
and it comprises many hundred acres of level
land free from buildings and any sort of overhead
wires. The island fronts the ocean on the south;
Point Loma on the west with the narrow entrance to
the bay between; to the north is the city of San
Diego across the bay; and Coronado just beyond
Spanish Bight on the east. This natural arrangement
gives good air conditions for beginners, and
also enables them to use the smooth waters of the
bay as well as the rough ocean water for the seaplanes.
The proximity of this location to San Diego
is also a distinct advantage. (See <a href="#ip_43">Fig. 11</a>.) All of
the structures of the aviation school on North Island
are temporary, the buildings consisting of a scattering
array of huge sheds.</p>

<p><i>Character of Instruction.</i>—Officers from all
branches of the army volunteer for this service. The
qualifications of an aviator are caution, judgment,
and technical skill. Deficiencies in caution and
judgment being temperamental are rarely remedied,
while technical skill is largely a matter of acquirement.
Less than ninety days are allowed for qualification
as a junior aviator, and if in that period the
officer’s deficiencies are found to be inherent, he
returns to his company.</p>

<p>The school is a place for hard work and quick
thinking. Detail in the repair shop is part of the
course, as is also the use of the gasoline engine in
motor trucks as well as in aircraft. (See <a href="#ip_54">Fig. 22</a>.)
Theory and practice are closely united: the former is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
carried on by means of bi-daily lectures, while the
early morning hours are devoted to flying. Pilot-and-observer
machines equipped with double control
are used in instruction. The aviation instructor
ascends with the student and allows him to manipulate
the controls, only resuming the management of
the airplane in an emergency. Needless to say, the
life of an instructor is a most hazardous one and full
of thrills. His duty is to be on the alert to correct
errors in the manipulation of the machine. After
every trip the instructor reviews, point by point, the
features of the flight, showing the pupil his deficiencies
and explaining how he may avoid them in the
future. The instruction is terse but kindly, and the
manner of imparting this information leaves nothing
to the imagination. After watching student and
instructor, and closely studying the finished work of
an aviator, it is my opinion that in no other occupation
must there be such perfect coördination between
mind and muscle: the perfectly qualified aviator is
the modern super-man.<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> The army aviator of today is picked for his quickness of mind and
body, and the first thing that strikes you about him is a sort of feline,
wound-up-spring alertness. Then you note his reticence, the cool reserve
of a man whose lot is to express himself in deeds rather than words. And,
lastly, there is the quiet seriousness, verging almost on sadness, of a man
who must hold himself ready to look death between the eyes at any
moment and yet keep his mind detached for other things.—Lewis R.
Freeman in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>.</p></div>

<p><i>Results of a Year’s Work.</i>—During the year 1915,
the students of the aviation school made 3,652
flights with a total time aloft of 1,516 hours, and a
mileage of 95,000. As regards weather conditions
affecting flights, it will be found interesting to
note <a href="#ip_32">Chart No. 5</a> giving number of flights and duration
for the fourteen months ending August, 1916,
which shows that work progressed regardless of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
weather, and at an increasing rate.<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> In February, a
military tractor-seaplane (an all-California product),
125-horsepower motor, with twenty-six gallons of
gasoline, four gallons of oil, and three passengers,
making a total weight of 3,100 pounds, reached an
altitude of 12,362 feet. This was the world’s record,
the previous altitude under the same conditions
having been 9,000 feet.</p>

<p><i>Activities of the Weather Bureau in Relation to
Aëronautics.</i>—Naturally the progress of aërial navigation
has at all times been rather closely connected
with the Weather Bureau. For over a decade the
Bureau has not been content with surface observations
but has maintained laboratories for the study
of the upper air. The results of its observations are
considered a mine of information for the student
aviator. Prof. Charles F. Marvin, the Chief of the
Weather Bureau, is a member of the National
Advisory Committee for Aëronautics, and chairman
of a subcommittee engaged on the determination of
the problems of the atmosphere in relation to aëronautics.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a></p>

<p>The first official coöperation between the Weather
Bureau and the War Department aviation school
was inaugurated in the year 1914 by Dr. W. J.
Humphreys, Professor of Meteorological Physics,
when he was detailed to give a course of lectures. It
was during this course that he lectured on “Holes in
the Air.”<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> This paper has been reprinted as a textbook
for the aviation school.</p>

<p><i>Early Studies in Aëronautics.</i>—Unofficially, however,
the coöperation extended back some fifteen
years prior to that time, when the writer was in
charge of the local office of the Weather Bureau at
San Diego, and assisted the aëronautical engineer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Octave Chanute, in his observations and experiments
on San Diego Bay.<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> At this time hundreds of photographs
of sea-gulls, pelicans, and other soaring birds
were made, and both birds and photographs studied
and analyzed. Ever since then more or less interest
has been taken by the writer in aërial navigation.
During an assignment to the Central Office the work
of the Wright brothers was observed and studied.
The association with the late Octave Chanute and
his friends, the Wrights, during their experimental
flights at Fort Meyer, Virginia, in September, 1908,
is counted among the many pleasant memories of
the Washington visit. It was here that was witnessed
the first flight with a passenger (see <a href="#ip_36">Fig. 4</a>), Mr.
Orville Wright taking up with him Major (now
Colonel) George O. Squier, the present head of the
aviation branch of the army. Such was the infancy
of the flying-machine that at that date no fatalities
had occurred. A few years later the writer had the
pleasure of accompanying Mr. Glenn Curtiss while
he was determining a site for his school, which was
finally located on North Island. (See <a href="#ip_38">Fig. 6</a>.)
Shortly afterward, from this place, Harry Harkness
made record amateur cross-country flights in an
Antoinette monoplane.</p>

<span class="subhead">NARRATIVE OF WEATHER OBSERVATIONS
FROM AN AIRPLANE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In order to qualify as meteorologist competent to
confer with aviators, it seemed desirable to become
personally acquainted with some of the conditions
that confronted them. As a matter of professional
acquirement therefore, I was glad to accept an invitation
to go aloft after the necessary official arrangements
had been made with Washington.</p>

<p>This trip was in line with the previous endeavors
of applying practical meteorology to the science of
flight and appropriately extended the work which was
begun in San Diego with Chanute and the sea-gulls
fifteen years before.</p>

<p><i>Object of Flight.</i>—I wished to put myself in the
student’s place and learn at first hand the practical
facts he demanded from weather observations and
to acquaint myself with everything possible that
might be of value to an aviator. There were two
definite things of which I desired knowledge: first,
to determine the height of the upward trend of the
sea-breeze over Point Loma which causes the mysterious
“woolly” of a score of years’ acquaintance
from a yachting standpoint; second, to observe the
extent, form, and composition of the velo cloud
which is the characteristic sun-cover of California.</p>

<p><i>Preparations for the Ascent.</i>—Aviator Instructor
Oscar Brindley (the 1915 winner of the Curtiss
trophy), in military tractor No. 50, was assigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
as pilot. It may be stated here that the accepted
definition of aviator is a pilot of a flying-machine
heavier than air. The airplane used in my first
flight (see <a href="#ip_45">Fig. 13</a>) was made in Los Angeles and is
the present standard army model. This tractor has
an 80-horsepower engine and 8-foot propeller. It is
21 feet long, has a wing-spread of 38 feet, supporting
area 364 square feet, and a flying radius, with two
persons, of 300 miles. The maximum altitude attained
with this model at San Diego was 13,000 feet.
Before being placed in service the machines are
thoroughly gone over at the repair shop (see <a href="#ip_54">Fig. 22</a>),
and the motors are run at full speed for twenty-four
hours, after which they are taken down and subjected
to scrutiny for possible defects. All of the struts,
guys, and wires are closely examined; the boltheads
are all drilled, wired, and soldered so that no amount
of vibration will loosen them. Regardless of the
length of the flight, each machine, before going up
again, is given a rigid inspection and not until the
mechanicians have tested every part is it pronounced
ready.</p>

<p>Not being prepared with a regulation aviation
suit, I was loaned a leather jacket by one officer, face-goggles
and safety helmet by others. I then took
my place in the observer’s seat forward and was
strapped into it with the safety belt (see <a href="#ip_44">Fig. 12</a>). I
was cautioned to let my body give way as the waist-controls
were moved from side to side and not pay
any attention to the steering rudder wheel which
had a way of mysteriously revolving, advancing and
receding.</p>

<p>In cranking an airplane, a certain formula is
always gone through. The mechanician at the propeller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
calls out, “Close!” The aviator closes the
switch and repeats the word. This short-circuits the
ignition apparatus so that no spark occurs in the
cylinders. The propeller is turned in order to introduce
explosive mixtures into the cylinders. When
ready to start the mechanician says “Open!” The
aviator opens the switch and repeats the word. The
charges in the cylinders then fire when the propeller
is turned.</p>

<p>After the engine starts, the machine is “trimmed”
by helpers and jockeyed for a favorable “take-off”
into the air. (See Figs. <a href="#ip_46">14</a>, <a href="#ip_47">15</a>.) This model of airplane
climbs on a gradient 1 to 7; its minimum speed
is 41 miles per hour. In other words, if the speed is
less than 41 miles per hour the machine will not fly
horizontally.</p>

<p><i>The Ascent.</i>—The tractor was headed into a 30-mile
northwesterly wind so that the “take-off” was
quick and easy; there were only a few seconds spent
rolling over the field, when the airplane left the
ground and I felt the never to be forgotten cushioning
feeling of the air. For ten seconds there was experienced
a decidedly weakening nervous chill, which
occurred to me once before when making a high dive
from a spring-board. It was the sort of physiological
disturbance that can only be counteracted by immediately
pulling one’s self together saying, “<em>Well,
here goes nothing!</em>” The momentary depression was
immediately followed by a corresponding elation of
feeling which strange to say did not leave me during
the trip and is always associated with thoughts of
the journey. There was no dizziness, although I am
peculiarly susceptible to the least change in balance.
The earth did not recede as we progressed steadily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
upward; we seemed part of the earth, but not of it.
Although the airplane reached an altitude of 3,000
feet in a comparatively few minutes, the barometer
falling from 30.0 to 27.0 inches, the decreased bodily
pressure was not at all noticeable.<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_H" href="#FNanchor_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> Trans-American Climatic Association, 1915, 31:20, Hot Springs, Va.</p></div>

<p>Next to the supporting quality of the atmosphere
I had noticed the 70-mile blast of air as the airplane
pushed its way steadily onward and upward. Naturally,
the exhaust of the motor in addition to the roar
of the wind made conversation impossible. Some
airplanes have telephone communication between
observer and pilot. (See <a href="#ip_41">Fig. 9</a>.) During one flight
in a machine not so equipped, the passenger noticed
the breaking of some apparatus. Knowing that it
was impossible to make himself heard he hastily
scribbled the word “Accident!” on a bit of card,
whereupon the pilot shut off his engine and glided
to earth.</p>

<p><i>Two-thousand Feet above Point Loma.</i>—Carrying
out my suggestion as to investigating the “woolly,”
the pilot drove the machine straight for Point Loma
and those unseen aërial breakers. Suddenly there
were two distinct “wallops” and I felt the fuselage
beneath me respond as if struck by a stuffed club.
There was evidently first a surge then a drop, and it
was the descending current of air that deprived the
airplane of the supporting medium, hence the shock.
Point Loma itself, from this altitude, and seen
directly from above, looked very like a barracuda’s
backbone—long, low, and ugly. Although this peninsula
(see <a href="#ip_53">Fig. 21</a>) is less than 500 feet high it so
effectively deflects the prevailing northwesterly wind
that the upward surge has been noticed by aviators<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
at an altitude of 4,000 feet. It is no wonder then
that these descending winds, called “woollies” (from
their churning the water into isolated masses which
look like tufts of wool), are dreaded alike by yachtsmen
and birdmen. They have been known to carry
away topsails from too closely venturing schooners
and student aviators always give the vicinity of
Point Loma a wide berth.</p>

<p><i>No Winds Aloft.</i>—We had not changed our direction
since leaving the ground, but after passing over
Point Loma the airplane was put sharply on a port
course. I had been expecting this and must confess,
somewhat dreaded it, innocently thinking that a
30-mile wind added to our 70-mile rate of speed
would “heel” the craft to an uncomfortable angle
when the course was changed from northwesterly to
southerly. What was my astonishment to find that
the putting about was unaccompanied by any of
the nautical motions such as tilting or canting. Theoretically
one may be ever so well grounded in physical
laws but it seems to take actual experience to bring
their truth home to us. Of course there can be no
wind in the air; when we entered the air it was
moving 30 miles an hour in relation to the earth
but as soon as we were free from the earth the velocity
of the wind had no effect on our flight. No
matter how strong the gale, so far as it concerned
the airplane, if the wind be steady no difficulty is
experienced; the aviator is concerned only by wind-shifts.</p>

<p><i>The Velo Cloud Seen from Above.</i>—In kindergarten
days I remember that one of the first questions I asked
was “Are clouds smoke?” And this early query was
really first answered in the air. Fog on a mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
top may be cloud, but somehow cloud free from close
proximity to the earth seems different.</p>

<p>The machine was put through the cloud blanket
much as a horse takes a hurdle; it seemed unlike
fog and more of a palpable substance. As we emerged,
the sun was shining on it like a silvery sea with
gently undulating surfaces and it looked for all the
world as supportable as layers of cotton-wool. Many
times have cloud-banks from mountain tops been
observed, yet the upper side of the velo cloud from
a flying-machine looked very different. The cloud
was only four or five hundred feet thick and extended
inland a few miles in irregular outline. The seaward
edges of the velo cloud were not ragged, and apparently
paralleled the coast for 10 or 15 miles.</p>

<p>Such was the exhilaration and confidence the air
gave that I can understand how parachute jumpers
confidently step off into space, for to them the air
is a supporting medium no more terrible than a
transparent sea to a good swimmer. I believe that
the record parachute drop was made in 1916 by
Colonel Maitland, of the English Royal Flying
Corps, who descended in a parachute 10,000 feet
from an airplane. Fifteen minutes was occupied in
the descent.</p>

<p><i>Ease of Vision at 3,500 Feet Altitude.</i>—At this
altitude the ease of vision is most remarkable. At
this height, <em>with perpendicular vision</em>, the eye is
possessed of wonderful powers. In those “solitudes
august with stars” men not only “mount up with
wings as eagles” but are given the eagle’s unobstructed
vision. Birds have been credited with much
too keen vision. From this height of several thousand
feet every object stood out with remarkable distinctness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Automobiles racing along the El Cajon boulevard
to Lakeside were readily picked up with the
unaided eye although 20 miles away. Looking down
over the aviation field the long compass mark and
the wind-direction pennant (Figs. <a href="#ip_51">19</a> and <a href="#ip_52">20</a>) were
easily distinguished. The bay and ocean, however,
gave the most remarkable revelation, for the bottom
of the bay and the shallow ocean shore were plainly
discernible. The absence of water as well as air
refraction explains why submarines cannot hide
from an airplane: one of the army aviators told me
that a submarine cannot ordinarily sink so low that
it cannot be seen from an airplane.</p>

<p><i>Color of Landing-ground Important.</i>—Owing to
the absorption and reflection of sunlight, there is a
distinct variation in the character of otherwise similar
landing-ground. A field, dark from recent plowing
(or burning), will heat the air over it faster than will
a field of stubble, hence over the former field there
will be the greater air disturbance, and this will
affect the ease of landing. Air is heated by contact
and convection. One of the aviators said that recently
he was descending, and had all but reached
the ground when a localized convectional current
hurled his machine upward some distance but immediately
afterward deposited him on the ground
without damage.</p>

<p><i>Spiraling Down 3,000 Feet.</i>—Speeding ever in wide
circles the course lay southeast over the upper part
of San Diego Bay. The city of San Diego presented
the usual checkerboard appearance (<a href="#ip_48">Fig. 16</a>), and
even at this altitude it would seem easy to drop an
orange at almost any point. The velo cloud was
lifting and we could see the gradual disappearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
as it melted rather than drifted from North Island.
(See <a href="#ip_49">Fig. 17</a>.)</p>

<p>The gliding descent was made from an altitude of
2,500 feet, starting above San Diego. As the aviation
school was approached, we could see a number of
machines in the air, three below and two above us,
circling about like hawks. And, like soaring birds,
these machines had their air-lanes, designated
courses and levels being devoted to the different
classes of machines. The landing was made without
incident and the hour’s flight was ended.</p>

<p><i>Outline of Meteorological Work at the Aviation
School.</i>—At the close of the lecture detail, the attention
of the student aviators was called to the importance
of their having as thorough knowledge as possible
of the fundamentals of meteorology. The application
of these fundamentals to the analysis of air
conditions met with in their daily flights was shown
to be essential. Investigations as to varying wind
direction were taken up by one of the staff instructors
by the use of small parachutes to be dropped at
different altitudes. (See <a href="#ip_40">Fig. 8</a>.) Through the
coöperation of the local official in charge of the San
Diego Weather Bureau station, duplicate signal
sheets were available from which the student officers
made their local weather maps. From these maps
and their own flights, they could arrive at some relationship
between the actual and the theoretical 3,000-
and 10,000-foot level maps prepared from the Bigelow
formula, as used by the Bureau. Lectures were
given on temperature and its distribution; winds,
moisture, and clouds were also made part of the
course, one of the papers of the Bureau<a id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> being reprinted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
by the aviation school by permission of the
Chief of the Bureau and used as a textbook. The
Weather Bureau furnished the station with a standard
set of meteorological instruments so that the
student officers could become perfectly familiar
with the regular equipment at the Weather Bureau
stations.</p>

<p><i>Extending the Usefulness of the Bureau to the
Aviators.</i>—Practical utilization by the aviators of
this district of the information possessed by the
Bureau has received considerable impetus during the
past six months. During the cross-country flights
of April and May, 1916, the Los Angeles station was
directed by the Chief of Bureau to furnish weather
and flight conditions between San Diego and Los
Angeles. With the aid of the general weather-map
data from the regular stations, and special observations
of wind, weather, and fog conditions on the
immediate coast near Los Angeles, and on Mount
Wilson, it was possible to issue satisfactory forecasts
of flying conditions. The eye-observations of fog-heights
as determined by the Weather Bureau coöperative
station at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory
were especially valuable. From this mountain
(6,000 feet elevation) it is possible on a good day
to see the whole length of the coast from Point Firmin,
San Pedro harbor to Point Loma, San Diego
Bay. Knowing different levels, the observer at
Mount Wilson was able to give actual thickness and
extent of the fog-belt and its past twenty-four-hour
history.</p>

<p><i>Balloon Soundings into the Stratosphere.</i>—It was
the writer’s privilege to be present when some highly
interesting and instructive experiments made by the
Weather Bureau in coöperation with the Smithsonian
Institution, in sounding the upper air were made at
Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of southern
California in July and August, 1913.<a id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a> The results
of this work were in close agreement with similar
soundings of the upper air throughout other surveyed
portions of the earth’s atmosphere, and a record
ascension for this country was made on July 30—32,643
meters or 20½ miles. In common with other
observations of temperatures in the stratosphere,
the minimum temperature of these soundings (-90 F.,
August 3) was registered within the first 10 miles.<a id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a></p>

<p><i>Diagram Showing Increase of Wind with Elevation
Data from Eight Meteorographs</i></p>

  <div class="captionl">
  <blockquote>

<p>From the article “Free Air Data in Southern California, July and
August, 1913” by Dr. Wm. R. Blair, Professor of Meteorology, in the
<cite>Monthly Weather Review</cite>, for July, 1914, it is learned that the wind shifts
from west to east rather abruptly at 16 to 20 km. (10 to 12 miles); below
this level down to about 5 km. (3 miles) it is quite uniformly from the
west. Extremes: Maximum wind velocity 21.2 miles, 5,000 meters
elevation, 5 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, July 24; minimum wind velocity 0.8 miles, 1,500 meters
elevation, 5 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, July 27.</p>

<p>The table shows a steady increase in velocity of the wind with elevation,
the data being obtained from the eight meteorographs. There were four
morning flights (July 31, August 3, 7, 8) and five afternoon flights (July
24, 27, August 3, 7, 8, 1913), and elevations were computed for nine
heights, 1,000 to 5,000 meters. Beyond the 5,000 meters the records show
that from 2 to 7 miles altitude the wind increases at approximately the
same rate that the density of the air decreases.</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>The peninsula of Point Loma rises to an elevation approximating 500 feet, and as it lies approximately north
and south, it interposes a considerable barrier to the prevailing westerly winds. The eastern side of Point Loma is
very precipitous. These factors tend to produce winds called “woollies” which are a distinct menace to all small boats
and air-craft, unless the air-craft have an elevation exceeding 3,000 feet on a normal windy day.</p></blockquote></div></div>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
